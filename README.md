# tanzu-spring-cloud-gateway-k8s

A guided tutorial for experimenting with Tanzu Spring Cloud Gateway and the API Portal on your laptop using a docker desktop k8s cluster.

This tutorial covers the following areas:
1. Pre-requisites
2. Install Spring Cloud Gateway for K8s - [link](#install-spring-cloud-gateway-for-k8s)
3. Install API Portal for VMware Tanzu - [link](#install-api-portal)
4. Deploy Animal Rescue Sample Application (Optional)
5. Cleanup

# Pre-requisites

* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
* [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/) 
* [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/#through-package-managers)
* [Tanzu Network Account](https://network.pivotal.io/) so you can download Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes and API Portal for Tanzu 

### MacOS 

* [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) with the 
  built-in k8s [MacOS k8s instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/kubernetes/) 

### Windows 

* Windows subsystem for Linux since there are bash scripts that need to be run 
*  [docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) with the
   built-in k8s [Windows k8s instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/kubernetes/)
   
### Validate prerequisites

1. Validate your kubectl is pointing at the docker desktop built in k8s. execute `kubectl cluster-info` 
   you should see output similar to what is below 

```text
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443
KubeDNS is running at https://kubernetes.docker.internal:6443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

To further debug and diagnose cluster problems, use 'kubectl cluster-info dump'.
```

2. check the version of helm you have installed using the command `helm version` this workshop has been tested with `version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.5.0",GitCommit:"32c22239423b3b4ba6706d450bd044baffdcf9e6", GitTreeState:"dirty", GoVersion:"go1.15.6"}` earlier versions might not work.

3. check the version of kustomize using the command `kustomize version` the workshop is tested with version 3.9.2

# Install Spring Cloud Gateway for K8s

## Download Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes 

1. Download the [Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes from Tanzu Net](https://network.pivotal.io/products/spring-cloud-gateway-for-kubernetes). This workshop
is tested with version 1.0.0 so make sure to download 1.0.x release. 

2. Extract the downloaded tar.gz file `tar zxf spring-cloud-gateway-k8s-1.0.0.tgz` you will find the files shown below.
```text
.
├── helm
│   └── spring-cloud-gateway-1.0.0.tgz
├── images
│   ├── gateway-1.0.0.tar
│   └── scg-operator-1.0.0.tar
└── scripts
    ├── install-spring-cloud-gateway.sh
    └── relocate-images.sh

3 directories, 5 files
```
3. Inspect the contents of the `images` folder. Notice it contains two container images packaged as `.tar` files. 
   the script located in `scripts/relocate-images.sh` is used to publish `gateway-1.0.0.tar` and 
   `scg-operator-1.0.0.tar` images into a private container registry accessible from the kubernetes cluster you 
   deploy the spring cloud gateway on.

4. Inspect the `helm` chart folder and notice that it contains a gzipped helm chart. This will 
   be used to install the spring cloud gateway operator. 
   
5. Inspect the `scripts` folder notice that it contains two shell scripts, one for publishing the private 
   container images to a registry, and the second scripts runs a helm to install the operator. 

## Load the SCGW container images into docker 

In a production deployment we would run the `scripts/relocate-images.sh` to publish the SCGW container images 
to a private container registry accessible from the k8s cluster that will be running SCGW. In this workshop
we are using Docker Desktop integrated Kubernetes, so we only need to load the container images into the local
docker desktop. 

1.  execute the command `docker load --input images/scg-operator-1.0.0.tar` to load the spring cloud gateway operator
container image into docker desktop, you should get output similar to the one below.

```

## Install Spring Cloud Gateway Operator

1. create a namespace to install spring cloud gateway into using the command `kubectl create namespace spring-cloud-gateway`

1. The spring cloud gateway operator is installed using helm. We will need to create a `scg-image-values.yaml` 
   file pointing at the  registry containing the SCGW container images. `scg-image-values.yaml` file is normally 
   generated when the `scripts/relocate-images.sh` is run. We did not run the script as we don't have private container
   registry to use during the workshop so will generate `scg-image-values.yaml` manually. In the `helm` folder 
   create a file called `scg-image-values.yaml` with the content below
   
```yaml
gateway:
   image: "dev.registry.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-gateway/gateway:1.0.0"
scg-operator:
   image: "dev.registry.pivotal.io/spring-cloud-gateway/scg-operator:1.0.0"
```

In the previous section we loaded the scgw container images to docker-desktop which makes the images available to 
the k8s provided by docker desktop, making our lab simpler to run on a laptop. 

4. Execute `./scripts/install-spring-cloud-gateway.sh` you should see output similar to below 
```text
 2021-03-04 14:10:49 ⌚  asaikali-a01 in ~/Downloads/spring-cloud-gateway-k8s-1.0.0

```

5. execute the command  `kubectl get all -n spring-cloud-gateway` you should see a pod running the spring cloud gateway 
operator as shown below. 
   
```text
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

deployment.apps/scg-operator   1/1     1            1           3m42s

NAME                                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/scg-operator-679f77dbb   1         1         1       3m42s
```

6. The spring cloud gateway operator installed three kubernetes custom resources definitions. Execute the command 
   `kubectl get crds` and you will see all the created custom CRDs shown below. These CRDs will be used to configure 
   the gateway. 
   
```text
 NAME                                              CREATED AT
springcloudgatewaymappings.tanzu.vmware.com       2021-03-04T05:47:20Z
springcloudgatewayrouteconfigs.tanzu.vmware.com   2021-03-04T05:47:20Z
springcloudgateways.tanzu.vmware.com              2021-03-04T05:47:20Z
```

## Define a gateway instance 

1. Inspect the `demo/my-gateway.yml` file it contains the YAML shown below which defines 
a spring cloud gateway instance.
   
```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGateway
metadata:
  name: my-gateway
```

2. Execute the command `kubectl apply -f demo/my-gateway.yml` which will submit a request to the cluster
to deploy an instance of spring cloud gateway. 

3. execute the command `kubectl get all` you should see a pod of the spring cloud gateway running
or being launched in the cluster's default namespace as shown in the output below.
   
```text
NAME               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/my-gateway-0   1/1     Running   0          3m36s

NAME                          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/kubernetes            ClusterIP   10.96.0.1       <none>        443/TCP    3h12m
service/my-gateway            ClusterIP   10.96.178.167   <none>        80/TCP     3m36s
service/my-gateway-headless   ClusterIP   None            <none>        5701/TCP   3m36s

NAME                          READY   AGE
statefulset.apps/my-gateway   1/1     3m36s
```

4. Inspect the file `demo/route-config.yml` it contains gateway configuration CRD that proxies requests
set the gateway to github. Notice that this route configuration is generic.  

```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGatewayRouteConfig
metadata:
  name: my-gateway-routes
spec:
  routes:
    - uri: https://github.com
      predicates:
        - Path=/**
      filters:
        - StripPrefix=1
```

5. run the command `kubectl apply -f demo/route-config.yml` you 

6. Inspect the file `demo/mapping.yml` notice that it points at the gateway instance we already deployed
at the configuration defined in `route-config.yml`
```yaml
apiVersion: "tanzu.vmware.com/v1"
kind: SpringCloudGatewayMapping
metadata:
  name: test-gateway-mapping
spec:
  gatewayRef:
    name: my-gateway
  routeConfigRef:
    name: my-gateway-routes
```

7. run the command `kubectl apply -f demo/mapping.yml` this will configure the already deployed 
   instance to pass proxy requests to github.com 
   
8. We don't have a load balancer configured with our kind cluster, so we will use port forwarding to
   test the gateway. run the command `kubectl port-forward service/my-gateway 8080:80` you will see 
   output like
```text
Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8080 -> 8080
Forwarding from [::1]:8080 -> 8080
```

9. Using a browser go to `http://localhost:8080` you should see the github site. The request are 
   going to spring cloud gateway which is then sending them to github.com. Congrats you have 
   managed to deploy a spring cloud gateway instance using a CRD. There are many more things
   that you can do with spring cloud gateway that we will discuss in the rest of the workshop this is 
   just the start. 
   

# Deploy Animal Rescue Sample Application (Optional)

The [animal rescue](https://github.com/spring-cloud-services-samples/animal-rescue/) sample 
application demonstrate many  commonly used features of spring cloud gateway. To deploy 
the application and use the login with Auth0 feature you will need a client secret provided
by the workshop instructor, look for it in the workshop Slack channel. 

1. Edit the file `animal-rescue/overlays/sso-secret-for-gateway/secrets/test-sso-credentials.txt` 
   set the `client-secret` value to the one provided on the workshop slack 
   
2. Deploy the app using the command `kustomize build ./animal-rescue/ | kubectl apply -f -`

3. Check the animal rescue components that are deployed into the cluster using the command 
   `kubectl get all -n animal-rescue` you should see output similar to the one below.

statefulset.apps/gateway-demo   2/2     6m54s
```

4. Notice that there are two instances of the gateway deployed, this makes the gateway 
   highly available within the k8s cluster. The gateway instances replicate data between 
   each other in order to track who is logged in into the application. 
   
5. Notice that there are two pods one running the front end application and one running the 
   backend api.
   
6. Notice that the front end and backend services are ClusterIP, so they can be reached 
   inside the k8s cluster but not from outside. We are going to need to reach the gateway to 
   direct traffic to the frontend and backend.
   
7. Since we are running on a laptop, and we don't have a loadbalancer we are going to use k8s
 port forwarding to direct traffic from localhost to the gateway service. Execute the command
   `kubectl port-forward service/gateway-demo 9090:80 -n animal-rescue`
   
8. Using a browser visit `http://localhost:9090/rescue` you will see the home page for the 
   application. click around on the application and explore it.
   
9. Click the login button in the top right corner, you will be redirected to Auth0 you can login
   with a Google account and then you will be sent back to the application where you will 
   be able to see the userid in the top right corner. 
   

# Install API Portal for VMware Tanzu

## Download Spring Cloud Gateway for Kubernetes

1. Download the [API Portal for VMware Tanzu from Tanzu Net](https://network.pivotal.io/products/api-portal/). <br>This workshop
   is tested with version 1.0.0 so make sure to download 1.0.x release.

2. Extract the downloaded tar.gz file `tar zxf api-portal-for-vmware-tanzu-1.0.0.tgz`; you will find the files shown below.
```text
.
api-portal-for-vmware-tanzu-1.0.0
├── helm
│   ├── api-portal-1.0.0.tgz
│   └── api-portal-image-values.yaml
├── images

├── jars
│   └── api-portal-server-1.0.0.jar
└── scripts
    ├── install-api-portal.sh
    └── relocate-images.sh

4 directories, 7 files
```
3. Inspect the contents of the `images` folder. Notice it contains a container imagea packaged as `.tar` file.
   <br>The script located in `scripts/relocate-images.sh` is used to publish the `api-portal-server-1.0.0.tar` image into a private container registry accessible from the K8s cluster you
   deploy the API Portal on.

4. Inspect the `helm` chart folder and notice that it contains a gzipped helm chart. <br>This will
   be used to install the API Portal.

5. Inspect the `scripts` folder notice that it contains two shell scripts, one for publishing the private
   container images to a registry (`relocate-images.sh`), and the second scripts runs a helm to install the API Portal (`install-api-portal.sh`)

## Load the API Portal container image into Docker

In a production deployment we would run the `scripts/relocate-images.sh` to publish the API Portal container images
to a private container registry accessible from the K8s cluster that will be running API Portal. 

In this workshop we are using Docker Desktop integrated Kubernetes, so we only need to load the container images into the local
Docker Desktop.
<br><br>
Instructions are provided for both deployment models.

1. Use the Docker CLI tool or your cloud provider CLI to authenticate to your image registry.
   
2.  Execute the command `docker load --input images/api-portal-server-1.0.0.tar` to load the API Portal  
    container image into docker desktop, you should get output similar to the one below.

````text
...
````

2. If you choose to install API Portal to a private container registry, you can use the relocate script as follows:
```shell
> ./scripts/relocate-images.sh <registry>/api-portal

For ex.:
> ./scripts/relocate-images.sh gcr.io/pa-ddobrin/api-portal
```

3. Check your local docker images `docker images` and look for spring cloud gateway images. You should output similar
   to below.

```shell
> docker images | grep portal
gcr.io/pa-ddobrin/api-portal/api-portal-server                         1.0.0                                                   5bb19cc71708   41 years ago    247MB
registry.pivotal.io/api-portal/api-portal-server                       1.0.0                                                   5bb19cc71708   41 years ago    247MB```
```

## Install API Portal

1. The installation will install the API Portal in the `api-portal` namespace.

2. The API Portal is installed using Helm. <br>We will need to create a `helm/api-portal-image-values.yaml`
   file pointing at the  registry containing the API Portal container images. `helm/api-portal-image-values.yaml` file is normally
   generated when the `scripts/relocate-images.sh` is run. We did not run the script as we don't have private container
   registry to use during the workshop so will generate `helm/api-portal-image-values.yaml` manually. In the `helm` folder
   create a file called `helm/api-portal-image-values.yaml` with the content below

```yaml
api-portal-server:
   image: "registry/api-portal/api-portal-server:1.0.0"
```

In the previous section we loaded the API Portal container images to docker-desktop which makes the images available to
the K8s provided by docker desktop, making our lab simpler to run on a laptop.

3. If you do not use docker-desktop and install into a dedicated K8s cluster, then the `scripts/relocate-images.sh` script 
   has already generated for you the `helm/api-portal-image-values.yaml` file with a content such as:
```yaml
api-portal-server:
   image: "<registry>/api-portal/api-portal-server:1.0.0"

# ex.:   
api-portal-server:
  image: "gcr.io/pa-ddobrin/api-portal/api-portal-server:1.0.0"
```
   
4. Execute `./scripts/install-api-portal.sh`. You should see output similar to below:
```text
> ./scripts/install-api-portal.sh

...
```

5. execute the command  `kubectl get all -n api-portal` you should see a pod running the API Portal
   as shown below.

```shell
> kubectl get all -n api-portal
NAME                                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/api-portal-server-846cfc847f-qf9t2   1/1     Running   0          6d19h

NAME                        TYPE        CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/api-portal-server   ClusterIP   10.0.25.217   <none>        8080/TCP   6d19h

NAME                                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```

6. API portal for VMware Tanzu displays API Groups and detailed documentation from 
   OpenAPI source URL locations. <br>To modify the OpenAPI source URL locations, 
   edit deployment’s environment variable `API_PORTAL_SOURCE_URLS` in the installation namespace, 
   `api-portal` by default.<br><br>
   Note that the API Portal discovers Spring Cloud Gateway instances in the same K8s cluster by 
   using the convention below:  
   
```shell
# Note
# This URL: http://scg-operator.spring-cloud-gateway/openapi is built as follows
# scg-operator - points to the Spring Cloud Gateway operator
# spring-cloud-gateway - deployed in this namespace
# openapi - at the openapi endpoint

# you can set up multiple locations in the same command, comma-separated  

> kubectl set env deployment.apps/api-portal-server API_PORTAL_SOURCE_URLS=http://scg-operator.spring-cloud-gateway/openapi -n api-portal
```

7. API portal restart after config changes

Please note that teh API Portal server must be restarted after each configuration change, as follows:
```shell
> kubectl rollout restart deployment api-portal-server -n api-portal
deployment.apps/api-portal-server restarted
```

8. Accessing the API Portal

In a local cluster, the easiest way to access the API Portal is by port-forwarding the Gateway instance and the API Portal:
```shell
# animal rescue was installed at 8080, and we have to use this port
> kubectl -n=animal-rescue  port-forward service/gateway-demo 8080:80

# pick a random port for API Portal
> kubectl -n=api-portal port-forward service/api-portal-server 8085:8080
```

URLs:
```shell
The API Portal is available at:
http://localhost:8085/apis

Animal Rescue app is available at:
http://localhost:8080/rescue
```

## Cleanup

1. SCG K8s
* delete the demo gateway `kubectl delete -f demo`
* delete the demo gateway `kustomize build ./animal-rescue/ | kubectl delete -f -`
* Uninstall the operator `helm uninstall spring-cloud-gateway -n spring-cloud-gateway`

2. API Portal
* helm uninstall api-portal -n `api-portal` 
* kubectl delete namespace `api-portal`
